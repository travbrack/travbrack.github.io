So far the only thing here is my little pokemon guessing game which can be played [here](https://travbrack.github.io/whodatpokemon_states/public/index.html). I'm aware of the bug with Mr. Mime. He's the only pokemon with a space in his name. Code is [here](./whodatpokemon_states/public/). Most of the game logic is in play.js.
